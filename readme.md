# metalsmith-concat

A Metalsmith plugin to concatenate files.

## Installation

```javascript
$ npm install metalsmith-concat
```

## Usage

### CLI

```javascript
{
  "plugins": {
    "metalsmith-concat": {
      "files": "styles/**/*.css",
      "output": "styles/app.css"
    }
  }
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import MetalSmith from "metalsmith";
import concat from "metalsmith-concat";

new Metalsmith(__dirname).use(
  concat({
    files: "styles/**/*.css",
    output: "styles/app.css"
  })
);
```

#### files

Type: `String` / `String[]`
Default: `'**/*'`

This defines which files are concatenated. This string will be interpreted as a
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern. An array of strings
will be interpreted as minimatch patterns, in this case the order of the
patterns matters (it will determine the order in which the files are
concatenated).

_Note: this is relative to the source path and the [search paths](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/metalsmith-concat#searchpaths) (if any)._

#### output

Type: `String`

It represents the filepath where the concatenated content will be outputted.
This option is **mandatory**.

_Note: this is relative to the destination path._

#### forceOutput

Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

By default metalsmith-concat return an error if the output file already exists.
You can force an existing output file to be overwritten by setting this option
to `true`.

#### insertNewLine

Type: `Boolean` | `String`
Default: `true`

Whether a trailing new line (`\n`) should be appended after each concatenated
file. Unless you face a problem, you should keep this option enabled as removing
it could cause invalid concatenated files (see [this
article](http://evanhahn.com/newline-necessary-at-the-end-of-javascript-files/)).
It is also possible to pass a string, in which case it will be used instead of
`\n`.

#### keepConcatenated

Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to keep the files which were concatenated. By default they are not kept
and deleted from the build (thus only keeping the newly created file at
`options.output`).

#### searchPaths

Type: `String` / `String[]`
Default: `[]`

The additional paths to search after the `src` directory given to Metalsmith.
The paths are resolved relatively to the metalsmith root directory. Absolute
paths can also been given. An ignore pattern is applied on the results to make
sure the `src` directory is not matched twice from a search path.

Let's consider the following example:

```
src/
  index.js
node_modules/
  react/
    dist/
      react.min.js
```

It is possible to include _React_ from the _node_modules_ before your _index.js_
from _src_ by using the following configuration:

```js
{
  files: [
    'react/dist/react.min.js', // found in node_modules
    'index.js' // found in src
  ],
  searchPaths: ['node_modules'],
}
```
